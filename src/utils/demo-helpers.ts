// This helper function is used to determine if the app is running in demo mode which we deploy at baas.stripe.dev
// To make it easier for you transition to a real production app, we've made it so that you can delete this code, all
// references to it, and logic guarded by it and the app will still work. The only thing that will change is that your
// app will start to behave like a real production app. For example, the Stripe Connect Onboarding forms will require
// filling out by your users.
