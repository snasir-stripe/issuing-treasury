## Example Stripe Treasury integration showing Embedded Finance


This demo is an application that allows you to quickly experiment with an
Embedded Finance experience.


With this application, you can:

- Sign up for a Stripe [Custom connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/custom-accounts) Account and for a Stripe Treasury Financial Account.

- Onboard using [Connect Onboarding](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/connect-onboarding) for Custom accounts.

- Display the Financial Account Balance.

- Display a chart to quickly visualize funds coming in and coming out.

- Display a transaction report.

- Create a cardholder and issue a card, using the Financial Account as the source of funds.

- Display the issued card information leveraging Stripe Elements.

- Display the Financial Account's Routing and Account numbers.

- Send money from the Financial Account, either using ACH or Wire Transfers.



In addition to these functions, there is also a *Test Mode only* section that will help platforms understanding the different mechanisms to fund Financial Accounts by:


- Simulating receiving a Transfer from an external account to a Financial Account.

- Creating a PaymentLink and then, paying out funds from the Connected Account balance to the Financial Account Balance.
